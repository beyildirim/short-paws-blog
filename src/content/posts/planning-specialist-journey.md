Every cat has a story, and mine began with an insatiable curiosity about organization. I would line up toys by size, schedule naps with precision, and track every sunbeam shift across the floor.

## The First Plan

My first real “project” was coordinating a team of humans to open cans at exactly 7:00 AM. The plan included:

- A clear alert system (meowing at 6:55)
- A backup escalation path (strategic knocking)
- Success metrics (on‑time breakfast)

It worked. That moment taught me that **planning is about alignment**—getting the right people, at the right time, with the right information.

## Growing into the Role

Over time I learned to balance detailed steps with the flexibility needed for real life. Plans are only as good as the team’s ability to adapt, so I focus on:

- Clear priorities
- Simple communication
- Feedback loops

## Today

Now I help teams turn complex ideas into actionable plans. The curiosity that once led me to explore every cabinet has evolved into a career centered on clarity and momentum.
