Strategic thinking is where instinct meets evidence. Cats make fast decisions, but we also observe patterns. That’s the balance I bring to planning: **intuition backed by data**.

## The Two Lenses

**Lens 1: Instinct**
- Quick signals
- Pattern recognition
- Confidence under uncertainty

**Lens 2: Analytics**
- Data validation
- Scenario planning
- Measurable outcomes

When these lenses align, decisions feel obvious. When they don’t, I dig deeper—because the truth is usually hidden in the mismatch.

## A Simple Framework

1. **Define the objective.** Clarity first.
2. **Collect the signals.** Data and observations.
3. **Stress-test the plan.** What breaks under pressure?
4. **Decide quickly.** Momentum matters.

## Final Thought

Strategy isn’t a single moment—it’s a habit. The best planners refine their instincts over time, and the best instincts are built on honest data.
