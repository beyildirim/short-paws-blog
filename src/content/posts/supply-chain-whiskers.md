As a cat with a keen eye for detail and natural curiosity, I've discovered that supply chain management is surprisingly similar to feline instincts. We both thrive on **anticipating movement**, **minimizing waste**, and **staying two steps ahead** of the unexpected.

## The Paw-Print Framework

When I look at a supply chain, I see a path of paw prints: each step must be intentional. A single misstep—an overstocked warehouse or delayed shipment—can send the entire trail off course. My approach focuses on three principles:

1. **Visibility:** If I can’t see it, I can’t pounce. Clear tracking and dashboards are non‑negotiable.
2. **Flexibility:** Cats adapt to tight spaces and changing environments. Your supply chain should too.
3. **Rhythm:** Predictable cycles create stability. That’s how you avoid late‑night scramble sessions.

## Small Tweaks, Big Wins

Sometimes the best improvements are micro‑adjustments. Shift a reorder point by 5%, consolidate a route, or align supplier schedules by one day. Over time, these changes create a smoother flow—like the perfect nap schedule.

## A Final Stretch

Supply chains are living systems. Treat them like you would a garden: prune, water, and keep an eye out for intruders. And remember—when the path is clear, you can move faster, sleep better, and deliver with confidence.
