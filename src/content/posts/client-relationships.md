In planning, trust is everything. Clients need to feel heard, informed, and confident that their goals are being respected.

## The Relationship Stack

**1. Reliability**
Deliver what you said, when you said.

**2. Transparency**
Explain tradeoffs early. Clients don’t like surprises.

**3. Empathy**
Ask about their real constraints—budget, time, risk tolerance.

## Small Touches, Big Impact

- Clear summaries after every meeting
- A shared timeline with visible milestones
- Proactive updates, even when things are going well

## Closing Note

Great relationships don’t happen by accident. They’re planned, nurtured, and protected—just like the best strategies.
